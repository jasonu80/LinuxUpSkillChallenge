Title: Basic Navigation -- Day 2
Source: https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/02/

Learning Objective: 
- Find the Documentation for the commands utilised.
- Navigate between different directories.
- Create, list, move, and delete files.

Commands Learned:
- `man` --> Details about a specific command
- `tldr` --> A short and simplified version of `man` command
- `apropos` --> Search for a keyword the commands to lookup for.
- `help` --> Display information of a specific command, similar like `man`, if the builtin command cannot support `man`.
- `type` --> Display the type of a command
- `hier` --> Information about specific files inside the linux directories, starting from '/'.
  Shortening of hierarchy, can be displayed via manual. 
- `cd <folder>` --> Move into different folders
  If the folder is not specified, it will go to the home directory.
- `pwd` --> Display the working directory
- `ls -ltra` --> list files on the current directory (All files and directories in the directory) 
  (`-ltra` is the same as `-l -t -r -a`)
- `mkdir <dirname>` --> Create a new directory
- `mv` --> Move a directory into a different directory
- `rmdir` --> Remove an empty directory
- `rm -r <dirname>` --> remove a file or a directory that is not empty.
  (For files, using `rm <filename>` is sufficient)
- `touch <name>.<format>` --> Create a new empty file
- `pushd <dirname>` --> Moves into <dirname> and saves it into a stack.
  (`pushd` with multiple directories will change the directory listing)
- `popd` --> Going back to the previous directory based on stack.
