Scenario and Goal: 
The developers requested that they need a specific directory structure for a new application called "Project Apollo", but they  need you to clean up a temporary lock file that’s stuck in another directory. You need to create its structure, verify its files, and reorganise it without losing your place in the terminal.
Steps:
1. Read the documentation about `mkdir` that specifies about creating parent directories.
2. Create a directory called `staging_server` and a file called `lockfile.tmp`.
3. Create a directory called `project_apollo/conf/local` without using `cd`.
4. Create an empty file called app.config.
4a. List the files in a long format.
5. Go back to the `staging_server` directory without using `cd`.
6. Remove the `lockfile.tmp` file and verify it.
